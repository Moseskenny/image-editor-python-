# image-editor-python-


This is my "Bulk-image-editor" script 

Running this script edits your images to "my style" of editing

Just choose the folder you want the images to be edited then choose a destination folder to save the edited images.

Feel free to make changes to the editing in the source code 
Used "pillow" library 
refer the documentation to make changes according to your style : https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

Thanks for using my project.
